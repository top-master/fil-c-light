# minilute builds in-place (it is not an extracted source archive). Its
# Makefile builds the vendored luau (projects/lute-1.0.0/extern/luau, release
# mode) and links the static libs; CC/CXX select the toolchain.
cd projects/minilute

# build_base.sh wipes pizfix, so any previously built minilute/luau objects
# were compiled and linked against the wiped libc and are stale (they may
# reference sonames/symbols the fresh libc no longer provides). Always force
# a from-scratch build of minilute and the vendored luau; it only takes
# seconds and keeps this script correct when run standalone, too.
