# and RDoc calls File.expand_path("~"), which requires a usable home directory.
# In minimal/container environments HOME can be unset or empty, and if the
# libc's getpwuid fallback doesn't yield a usable home either, rdoc dies with
# "no implicit conversion of nil into String". Give the build a real HOME.
