   Freeing objects is optional in Fil-C, since Fil-C is garbage collected.
   
   Freeing an object in Fil-C does not cause memory to be reclaimed immediately. Instead, it changes
   the upper bounds of the object to be the lower bounds and sets the free flag. This causes all
   subsequent accesses to trap with a Fil-C panic. This has two GC implications:
   
   - The GC doesn't have to scan any outgoing pointers from this object, since those pointers are not
     reachable to the program (all accesses to them now trap). Hence, freeing an object has the
     benefit that dangling pointers don't lead to memory leaks, as they would in GC'd systems that
     don't support freeing.
     
   - The GC can replace all pointers to this object with pointers that still have the same integer
     address but use the free singleton as their capability. This allows the GC to reclaim memory for
     this object on the next cycle, even if there were still dangling pointers to this object. Those
     dangling pointers would already have trapped on access even before the next cycle. Switching to
     the free singleton is not user-visible, except via ptr introspection like `%P` or
     `zptr_to_new_string`.
   
   libc's free just forwards to this. There is no difference between calling `free` and `zgc_free`. */

   If you try to encode a ptr to a free object, you get 0. If you decode 0 or if the object that
   would have been decoded is free, this returns NULL. Valid pointers encode to some non-zero
   integer. You cannot rely on those integers to be sequential, but you can rely on them to:

   - Stay out of the the "null page" (i.e. they are >=16384) just to avoid clashing with
     assumptions about pointers (even though the indices are totally no pointers).

   - Fit in 32 bits unless you have hundreds of millions of objects in the table.
