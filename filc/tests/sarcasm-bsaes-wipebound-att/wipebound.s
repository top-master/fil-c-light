# Runtime proof for the bsaes key-schedule wipe-bound recomputation
# (projects/openssl-3.6.4/crypto/aes/asm/bsaes-x86_64.pl, ECB encrypt and
# decrypt done-paths): gas compares the wipe pointer against %rbp (the
# fixed frame top) as the end pointer, but under SARCASM %rbp never
# covered the GC `.alloca`, so the bound is rebuilt as end=base+size in
# %r11 from the round count in %ebx:
#
#   mov %ebx,%r11d; shl $7,%r11; sub $(128-32),%r11; mov base,%r10; add %r10,%r11
#   .Lwipe: movdqa %xmm0,(%rax); movdqa %xmm0,16(%rax); lea 32(%rax),%rax
#           cmp %rax,%r11; ja .Lwipe
#
# (128 bytes per inner round key, minus a constant 128-32 for the
# separately-saved tail -- the exact .pl arithmetic, so the wiped span is
# rounds*128-96). This test pins the formula: for several round counts the bytes [base, base+rounds*128-32) are zeroed and the bytes
# after are untouched, including the short-path shape (no schedule was
# ever built -- the wipe still covers the empty region harmlessly).
