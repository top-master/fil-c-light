/* This function is internal (it has a GLIBC_PRIVATE) version, but it
   is widely used (either via weak symbol, or dlsym) to obtain the
   __static_tls_size value.  This value is then used to adjust the
   value of the stack size attribute, so that applications receive the
   full requested stack size, not diminished by the TCB and static TLS
   allocation on the stack.  Once the TCB is separately allocated,
   this function should be removed or renamed (if it is still
   necessary at that point).  */
