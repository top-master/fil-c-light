/* glibc's stock __dl_iterate_phdr walks the internal link_map and hands the
   callback pointers straight into the host ELF images (dlpi_name, dlpi_phdr),
   which user (Fil-C) code cannot legally form a pointer to, so Fil-C traps.
   Route the call through zsys_dl_iterate_phdr instead: the runtime enumerates
   the loaded objects with the host dl_iterate_phdr and rebuilds each struct
   dl_phdr_info in capability-safe Fil-C objects before invoking the callback.
   This is the glibc twin of the usermusl routing, so dl_iterate_phdr works
   under both libcs rather than only musl.

   The stock __dl_iterate_phdr reported only the objects in the caller's link-map
   namespace (Lmid_t).  Fil-C has no namespace support -- there is no dlmopen, so
   every object lives in the sole base namespace -- hence enumerating all loaded
   objects (what the runtime does) is exactly the caller's namespace, and dropping
   the RETURN_ADDRESS/namespace bookkeeping changes no observable behaviour.  */
