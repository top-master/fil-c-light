# Runs 'make check' with default signal dispositions.
#
# When the build runs in a batch environment (setsid/nohup, or an unprivileged
# container without a controlling tty), SIGINT and SIGQUIT are ignored on entry
# and a POSIX shell cannot reset them. Some test suites (e.g. gnulib's
# test-execute, used by m4 among others) require the default dispositions -
# they raise SIGINT in a child and expect it to die. python3 can reset the
# dispositions (the cannot-reset-ignored-signals rule is shell-specific), so
# use it as an exec launcher when SIGINT is ignored on entry. Note that python
# itself ignores SIGPIPE (and SIGXFZ/SIGXFSZ) at startup, so the launcher must
# explicitly reset those too or they'd propagate to the tests (gnulib's
# test-execute case 3 expects a child to die from SIGPIPE). Falls back to a
# plain 'make check' when python3 is unavailable or signals are fine.
