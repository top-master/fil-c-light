   Also, this is an atomic operation with full fencing. In some parts of the GC algorithm, you can (and should)

   - Not use atomics. You can get away with that under certain conditions. For example: if you know that you are
     setting or clearing all of the mark bits in a word and nobody else is looking to do the opposite of you.

   - Use relaxed atomics. For example, parallel marking can (and should) use unfenced CAS to set mark bits on
     those CPUs that have such a thing, since based on the Riptide experience, that's worth significant overall
     throughput. But you cannot do that for conservative marking (see verse_heap_inlines.h, comment above
