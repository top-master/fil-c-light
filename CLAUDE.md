# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Fil-C is a memory-safe implementation of C and C++ created by Filip Pizlo at Epic Games. It provides full C/C++ compatibility while preventing all memory safety errors through a combination of concurrent garbage collection and invisible capabilities (InvisiCap system).

Key characteristics:
- **Memory Safety**: All pointers carry capabilities tracking bounds and type information
- **GIMSO Principle**: "Garbage In, Memory Safety Out" - no unsafe escape hatches
- **Garbage Collection**: Uses FUGC (Fil's Unbelievable Garbage Collector) - concurrent, non-moving GC
- **Platform**: Currently Linux/X86_64 only
- **Performance**: 1.5x-5x slower than standard C (actively being optimized)

## Build System

### Initial Setup
```bash
# For source builds (primary development workflow)
./setup_gits.sh     # Clone/setup all required repositories

# Build options (choose one):
./build_all.sh                    # Basic build with musl
./build_all_glibc.sh              # Use glibc instead of musl

# For binary releases
./setup.sh
```

### Core Build Components (Essential)
- `build_base.sh` - LLVM/Clang compiler
- `build_runtime.sh` - Fil-C runtime (libpas)
- `build_yolomusl.sh` / `build_usermusl.sh` - musl libc implementations (both essential)
- `build_cxx.sh` - C++ standard library (essential)

### Alternative Libc (if using glibc)
- `build_yolo_glibc.sh` / `build_user_glibc.sh` - glibc implementations

### Quick Builds
- `build_all_fast.sh` - Essential components only
- `build_all_slow.sh` - All ported applications

## Testing

### Test Runner
```bash
filc/run-tests                    # Run all tests
filc/run-tests --filter regex     # Run tests matching pattern
filc/run-tests --test testname    # Run specific test
filc/run-tests --verbose          # Verbose output
filc/run-tests --no-run           # Compile only, don't run
```

### Test Structure
- Tests live in `filc/tests/*/` directories
- Each test has a `manifest` YAML file defining expectations
- Test runner generates build scripts and runs multiple configurations
- Configurations include: default, scribble (verification), STW (stop-the-world), release

### Running Individual Tests
Tests are compiled to `filc/test-output/testname/` with scripts:
- `compile.sh` - Build the test
- `justRun.sh` - Run with debug runtime
- `subRun*.sh` - Run with different GC configurations

## Development Workflow

### Using Fil-C Compiler
```bash
# Basic compilation
build/bin/clang -o program program.c -g -O

# C++ compilation  
build/bin/clang++ -o program program.cpp -g -O -std=c++20

# Must use -g for meaningful error messages
# Must use -O with -g to avoid compiler crashes
```

### Key Directories

**Compiler Implementation:**
- `llvm/lib/Transforms/Instrumentation/FilPizlonator.cpp` - Main LLVM pass implementing Fil-C transformations

**Runtime System:**
- `libpas/src/libpas/filc_runtime.{h,c}` and `libpas/src/libpas/filc_runtime_inlines.h` - Core runtime implementation
- `libpas/src/libpas/fugc.{h,c}` - Garbage collector
- `libpas/src/libpas/filc_start_program.c` - Program startup trampoline

**Fil-C Headers and Runtime:**
- `filc/include/stdfil.h` - Main Fil-C header
- `filc/src/` - Runtime components written in Fil-C
- `filc/main/` - Program entry point

**Libc Implementations:**
- **musl**: `projects/yolomusl/` (yolo libc), `projects/usermusl/` (user libc)
- **glibc**: `projects/yolo-glibc-2.40/` (yolo libc), `projects/user-glibc-2.40/` (user libc)

**Ported Applications:**
- `projects/*` directories contain memory-safe versions of various software packages
- `pizfix/` - Staging environment for compiled Fil-C programs

## Projeny

- **What projeny is**: Fil-C's tool for tracking third-party projects in `projects/` without checking in huge vendor trees. Each projeny-managed project is checked in as exactly two git-tracked files: the pristine upstream distro tarball (e.g. `projects/dash-0.5.13.5.tar.gz`) and a `<name>.projeny` file (e.g. `projects/dash.projeny`) containing `Archive:`/`Origname:`/`Name:` headers, indented prose, and a git-style patch with all Fil-C changes (labels `a/<Name>/... b/<Name>/...`). A `.projeny` file may alternatively use repeatable `URL: <url> <blake3-hash>` headers instead of `Archive:` (mutually exclusive): no tarball is checked in — `setup` downloads it with linked-in libcurl, verifies it with vendored blake3 (`projects/projeny/src/blake3`; `projeny hash <file>` computes the hash), and caches it in the same `.<archive>.snapshot` file, hitting the network only when that snapshot is missing or matches no URL hash. Mirrors are tried in listed order (warn + next on failure/mismatch); `rebase` takes either exactly one new-tarball path (classic form, Archive:-based projects only) or one or more `<url> [<blake3-hash>]` pairs (hash optional — when omitted it is computed from the download; every listed URL is downloaded and verified during the rebase, and a hash that mismatches is a hard error) — the URLs become the file's `URL:` headers, so `rebase` converts an Archive:-based project to URL:-based and moves a URL:-based project to new URL(s)
- **Untracked files** (generated by `projeny setup`): the unpacked checkout `projects/<Name>/`, the state file `projects/.<name>.projeny.status` (`Status:`/`Conflict:`/`Added:`/`Removed:`/`Renamed:` lines + a delimiter + a byte-exact embedded copy of the `.projeny` file), and a `.<archive>.snapshot` byte-exact tarball copy
- **Currently projeny-managed projects** (grows over time; look for `*.projeny` in `projects/`): attr, blake3, brotli, dash, icu, libedit, libffi, libidn2, libxml2, m4, mg, openssl, patchelf, pkgconf, tmux, util-linux, yolo-util-linux
- **Editing workflow — the critical rules**:
  - Edit the unpacked checkout (e.g. `projects/dash/src/...`), NEVER the `.projeny` file's patch by hand. The patch is tool-maintained
  - NEVER unpack a tarball and edit the unpacked copy as a way of making changes, and never modify/re-create tarballs: tarballs must stay pristine upstream source distros; every Fil-C change lives in the `.projeny` patch
  - Before staging a git change, run `filc/projeny commit projects/<name>.projeny` to fold workdir changes into the `.projeny` patch, then `git add` it. Multiple edit → `projeny commit` rounds are fine: they collapse into one net patch change
  - File bookkeeping: `projeny add` / `projeny rm` / `projeny mv` record pending file additions/removals/renames (they also perform the on-disk operation, except `add`); `projeny resolve <f>.projeny <path>` clears a resolved conflict; commit refuses disappeared files that were not `projeny rm`'d, and ignores files that were never `projeny add`ed
  - `projeny setup projects/<name>.projeny` unpacks + patches the tarball into `projects/<Name>/`; when run on an existing checkout it merges local (uncommitted) changes onto a new base and leaves conflict markers + `Conflict:` entries for you to resolve
- **Command reference** (one-liners):
  - All project-taking commands accept the `.projeny` file, the checkout dir (existing or not, if a `<name>.projeny` sibling exists), or a dir holding a single `.projeny` — like `package`/`extract` always have. The dir-sibling rule requires the sibling's `Name:` header to equal the directory's basename (the checkout is always named by `Name:`): a mismatch dies (`'<sibling>' names the checkout directory '<other>', not '<dir>'`), while an unparseable (e.g. git-conflicted) sibling keeps the old behavior so `setup` can still recover it
  - `setup` - Unpack+patch, merge on base change (and say honestly when there was nothing to merge); also the only command that handles git conflict markers inside a pulled `.projeny` file
  - `commit` - Regenerate the patch from tarball+workdir
  - `add` / `rm` / `mv` / `resolve` - File bookkeeping (see editing workflow above)
  - `rebase <f>.projeny <new-tarball>` - Move the patch to a newer tarball (or `rebase <f>.projeny <url> [<hash>] [<url> [<hash>]...]` to rebase onto new URL: header(s); a URL:-based project accepts only the URL form)
  - `create <f>.projeny <new-tarball>` (or `create <f>.projeny <url> [<hash>] [<url> [<hash>]...]` — rebase's exact archive-arg grammar, shared parser) - Compose a brand-new `.projeny` file (`Archive:`/`URL:` lines, then `Origname:` inferred from the archive's single top dir, then `Name:`, then `--comment` prose) and run `setup`. `--origname <name>` names the checkout directory: the file gets BOTH `Name: <name>` AND `Origname: <name>` (must match the archive's top dir, else refused before anything is written), so the checkout is `<pdir>/<name>` while the file stays `<f>.projeny`. When the file exists: no `--force` refuses; one `--force` erases the old project's setup state with erase-setup's no-force check; two erase unconditionally; `--erase-snapshots` passes through. Corner guard: with `--origname`, a pre-existing `<pdir>/<name>` dir is erased (at `--force`+) only when attributable — attribution consults two sources in order: the replaced file itself (when it exists, parses, and carries `Name: <name>`, its own erase cleans up the checkout, so no eviction is armed), then its `<name>.projeny` sibling (which is evicted); only when neither source attributes the dir does the guard refuse — an unattributable dir is NEVER removed at any force level. URL-mode create downloads+verifies every URL (hash computed when omitted) and writes the first verified bytes to the snapshot named after the first URL's basename, so the following setup downloads nothing
  - `status` - Modified/Disappeared/Untracked + pending ops
  - `diff <f.projeny>` - See below
  - `diff <dir> <other-dir>` - Raw tree-vs-tree patch
  - `patch <dir> <patch-file>` - Apply with conflict markers
  - `package` / `extract` - Tracked-files-only tarballs
  - `setup`/`package`/`extract` accept multiple projects (`setup a.projeny b.projeny ...`; package/extract take (project, output/dest) pairs) and run them in parallel: `-j/--jobs` threads (default the CPU count; also the blake3 hash-check threads), `-c/--curl-jobs` curl transfers in flight (default 8). The URL: downloads of every named file are collected first and deduplicated by archive basename — shared archives download exactly once and every file gets the same archive file — with ALL-CAPS warnings when files share an archive name but disagree on URL sets or hashes; duplicate project arguments collapse into one operation with a warning. The batch download reports ONE combined progress line (`projeny: download progress: <e1> <e2> ...`, bare-`\r`-redrawn like the single-project line): one single-token entry per package the pass has announced so far, in first-announcement order, in a roster that only ever grows (a completed transfer stays listed at `100%`) — whole-percent `N%` when the total size is known, else the bytes so far in compact units (`0B`, `65535B`, `37KiB`, `1.2MiB`; never `?`) — throttled to ≥200ms + visible change, closed by one deterministic final line listing every package of the round (`100%` per transferred package, `0B` for one that never finished one) on its own line; in multi mode the per-project phase stays silent about snapshots (`using existing snapshot` notes are single-project-only)
  - `download <url> <hash> [<url> <hash>...]` - Fetch URL/hash pairs into the cwd as one parallel batch (same combined download progress line as the multi-project commands), naming each file after the URL's basename (same 64-hex blake3 hashes a `URL:` header wants); a file already present with a matching hash is kept instead of re-downloaded, and any failure exits nonzero after the other packages finished
  - `erase-setup <f>.projeny [<f>.projeny...]` (parallel, `-j/--jobs`, `--erase-snapshots`, `--force`) - DESTRUCTIVE: rm -rf's the checkout (`Name:` dir), deletes `.<f>.projeny.status` (both name forms) and silently deletes `<f>.projeny.setup-journal`; missing things warn (`did not exist; nothing to erase`), never error; a deletion that fails prints an error, fails that project (exit 1 + summary line) but the rest of the deletions still run. `--erase-snapshots` also deletes exactly the `.<archive>.snapshot` the next setup would use (never the checked-in tarball, never similar-named snapshots) so the next setup re-downloads/unpacks fresh. Without `--force`, nothing is erased until every project passes a parallel check (subject to `-j`): each project's status (the same machinery `status` uses; a missing workdir or absent status file is clean and skips it) must report nothing a commit would fold in — any Conflict/Added/Removed/Renamed/Modified/Disappeared entry is dirty, untracked files alone are fine. Any dirty project (or one whose state cannot be assessed: unreadable/unparseable `.projeny`, unreadable status file, or a checkout whose archive and snapshot are both missing/unusable so the live diff cannot run) refuses the WHOLE invocation with one die report + bullet list and exit 1, erasing nothing, not even clean projects. `--force` skips the check and erases unconditionally (combines with `--erase-snapshots`). Never touches the `.projeny` file itself
- **`projeny diff <f>.projeny` semantics** (new feature; the gory details):
  - Prints the uncommitted change: workdir vs. what a fresh `projeny setup` of the current `.projeny` would check out (tarball + current patch)
  - Refuses when the `.projeny` file differs from the status file's embedded copy ("run setup to merge first") or when unresolved conflicts exist
  - Pending `mv`/`add`/`rm` ops are rendered as rename/add/delete blocks (an `mv` shows as a rename even when the moved file's content diverged)
  - Untracked files (never `projeny add`ed) are ignored — except files created inside a directory that a pending `mv` moved: the move destination is a registered add-side entry, so new files under it ride along in the diff and in the commit
  - Files that vanished locally without `projeny rm` produce a stderr warning and are left out of the diff
  - stdout carries only the patch; warnings go to stderr; exit 0 whenever the diff itself succeeds
  - `projeny commit` uses the same patch generation but a different baseline: the diff is against the checked-in tree (tarball + current patch, what a fresh `setup` would produce) while the stored patch is against the raw tarball. For ordinary edits they are the same patch; they differ only when a pending `mv` renames a file the last commit itself added or renamed — the diff describes the move against the checked-in paths, while `commit` re-derives the rename from the tarball's paths (a committed-added file commits as a plain add of its new name; a committed rename re-traces to the original tarball path). Each output is correct for its own baseline
- **Building projeny**:
  - `./build_projeny_yolo.sh` - Builds it with the system C++ compiler into `projects/projeny/build-yolo/` and installs the binary as `filc/projeny` (runs early in `./build_base.sh` so a working projeny exists before builds need it)
  - `./build_projeny.sh` - Builds it with Fil-C (`build/bin/clang++`) into `build-filc/` and runs the test suite
  - Run tests anytime with `make -C projects/projeny test` (single self-contained script `projects/projeny/tests/run_tests.sh`, needs bash, tar, and python3)
  - Projeny shells out ONLY to `tar` and `cp -a`; diff/patch/3-way-merge are internal (git-compatible unified diffs; binaries as base64 `GIT binary patch` blocks) — never `git`, `diff`, or `patch` binaries
- **Container note**: `./enter_container.sh -n` is the reference container setup: it installs gcc-12/g++-12 as the default `gcc`/`g++` and builds binutils 2.47 into `/usr/local` (plus m4/autoconf/automake/libtool etc. from `pizlix/` sources). Match it before running `./build_all_glibc.sh` or other glibc builds; `./build_all.sh` (musl) most likely works on an older container
- **Design notes** (untracked files in the repo root, historical): `projeny.txt` (original design doc), `projeny-adds.txt`, `projeny-improvements.txt`, `projeny-merging.txt`

## Architecture Notes

### Two-Libc Architecture
Fil-C uses a "sandwich" architecture:
1. **Yolo libc** (bottom) - Minimally modified libc for runtime use
2. **Fil-C runtime** (middle) - Memory safety layer  
3. **User libc** (top) - Heavily modified libc that applications use

Both yolo and user libc implementations are essential - you cannot have a working Fil-C system without both.

### InvisiCap System
- Each pointer has an associated invisible capability
- Capabilities stored in auxiliary allocations, not visible to C address space
- Pointers in registers use two registers (pointer + capability)
- Enables full C compatibility while maintaining memory safety

### Safety Guarantees
- Out-of-bounds access detection (heap and stack)
- Use-after-free prevention
- Type confusion prevention
- Pointer race detection
- System call argument validation

## Common Issues

### ABI Slice Problem
- Fil-C code cannot link with regular C code
- Must port entire dependency chains to Fil-C
- This is fundamental due to incompatible pointer representations

### Debugging
- Always compile with `-g` for meaningful error messages
- Use `FUGC_STW=1` to force stop-the-world GC for debugging GC issues
- Use `FUGC_SCRIBBLE=1 FUGC_VERIFY=1` for memory corruption debugging
- Use `FILC_DUMP_SETUP=1` to verify environment variable settings (useful when using other debugging flags)

### GC Stress Testing
- Use `FUGC_MIN_THRESHOLD=0` to increase GC churn for stress testing (not for performance tuning)
- Default `FUGC_MIN_THRESHOLD` value is generally optimal for performance

### Performance Tuning
- Current bottlenecks: calling convention overhead, capability access patterns
- Use `-O2` or `-O3` for best performance
