# I'd love to use this test suite, however it's not robust against concurrent invocation. I consider
# it a P1 that you should be able to run build_all.sh multiple times in parallel on the same box, so
# long as each build_all.sh invocation is on a different checkout. All other test suites in Fil-C
# allow this. But libuv's doesn't. For example, the udp_send_unreachable test fails with ADDRINUSE if
# you run the test in parallel with itself.
