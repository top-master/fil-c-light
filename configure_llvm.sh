# Note: the C++ runtimes (libc++ and libc++abi) are not configured here. They
# are built as a standalone cmake project against the Fil-C compiler by
# build_cxx.sh, so that changing runtimes-only options (like whether the
# runtimes are built against musl or glibc) never forces LLVM to be rebuilt.

# The compiler builds the backend of the host architecture plus the backend
# of the other supported Fil-C architecture, so that one Fil-C clang can
# cross-build both arches (e.g. the aarch64 flavor of the cosmo build, see
# build_yolocosmo.sh).
